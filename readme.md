This is my solution to the Veo technical test.

The app presents a list of trending movies and by clicking one of them a details screen is shown.

Please note that The Movie Database api returns 404 for some movies when trying to get the details.
The app will handle this error by displaying an appropriate message to the user.

Please note that the file ListViewModelTest.kt in the test source set contains a couple of unit tests that should all be green.
